# Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to build a neural network model to predict [specific outcome, e.g., the success of funding applications] using historical data. By identifying important features and building a predictive model, we aim to support decision-making and improve efficiency in [specific field or organization].

# Results

Data Preprocessing

Target Variable(s):

	•	The target variable for this model is IS_SUCCESSFUL. It indicates whether each application is successful (1) or not (0).
	•	Feature Variable(s):
	•	The features used for the model include:
	•	APPLICATION_TYPE
	•	INCOME_AMT
	•	AFFILIATION
	•	USE_CASE
	•	CLASSIFICATION
	•	STATUS
	•	ORGANIZATION
	•	SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS
	•	After converting categorical data to numeric with pd.get_dummies, these features are transformed into multiple columns representing
    
the original categorical values.

	•	Removed Variables:
	•	EIN and NAME were removed from the dataset as they are unique identifiers that do not contribute to the prediction and could potentially introduce noise into the model.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

	•	Neural Network Architecture:
	•	Layers:
	    •	First hidden layer: 64 neurons, ReLU activation function
	    •	Second hidden layer: 32 neurons, ReLU activation function
	    •	Output layer: 1 neuron, sigmoid activation function
	•	Reasoning:
	•	The number of neurons in each layer was chosen based on the complexity of the data. The ReLU activation function was selected for the hidden layers to introduce non-linearity, which allows the model to capture more complex relationships in the data. The sigmoid function in the output layer is appropriate for binary classification as it outputs probabilities between 0 and 1.
	•	Model Performance:
	    •	The model achieved an accuracy of 72.36% on the test dataset, with a loss of 0.5644.
	    •	Although this accuracy is reasonable, it may fall short of optimal performance depending on the use case’s requirements.
	•	Steps to Improve Performance:
	    •	Data Scaling: Implemented StandardScaler to standardize features, improving model performance by ensuring each feature contributes equally.
	    •	Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimented with the number of neurons and layers to find the optimal balance between complexity and generalization.
	    •	Early Stopping: Implemented early stopping (if applicable) to prevent overfitting and optimize training time.
	    •	Additional Preprocessing: Replaced rare categorical values with “Other” to reduce noise and improve generalization.

# Summary

The deep learning model provided a reasonable accuracy of 72.36% in predicting the target variable. While this performance is useful, it may be improved further with additional data or fine-tuning. Tried running the model with an additional layer, and adding dropouts with no success. Adding hyperparameter tunning may improve the accuracy also.
